To learn about class logic and metaclasses,
we made a series of code transformations:

regular            Real class that we are trying to model
dict               Show the underlying dicts
function           Add functions:  make_class, make_inst, class_lookup, inst_lookup
operator           Use __getattr__ for lookup:    Dog(Fido)   Dog.bark     d.bark()
class              Use the class-keyword to do the exec for us
new-style          Add the __get__ descriptor hook
